<p>This academic year had been useful & informative for students inspite of the pandemic situation. The online platform provided by the school  helped us to motivate the students  in creating environmental awareness & also conducted various activities to conserve the environment. 
 The above quote embodies the very purpose of quizzing.    <br><br>
    As a part of Eco club, the students of class VIII made impressive posters for eco-friendly Diwali during the month of November 2020.This inculcated in them to keep the environment pollution free. They conveyed the message of CLEAN DIWALI-GREEN DIWALI and promoted the requirement of saving environment. 
    <br><br>    In the first week of December 2020, we have assigned a paper mache activity named as “Wealth out of waste” for class VI. The aim of this activity was to raise awareness among students regarding not to throw used things which can be used in different ways like decorative pieces, storage box, etc. All the students participated very enthusiastically and made beautiful decorative pieces, wall hangings, boxes with waste materials. This activity gave the message of reduce, reuse and recycle too.
     Hence the students enjoyed and learned the ways of conservation of nature, the importance of cleanliness of surroundings and minimizing the use of natural resources.
